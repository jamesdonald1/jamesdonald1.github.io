Windows smash, dogs shout, felines squeal, infants sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not need a new keypad. Using several sensors to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the client.
