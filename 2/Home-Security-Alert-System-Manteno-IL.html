<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it needs to be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
