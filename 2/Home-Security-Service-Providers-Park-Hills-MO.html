<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage space. So much, in truth, that they require about four times the hard drive space of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is important.</p>
