<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Tenants, unlike property owners, usually avoid making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be established at different properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also allow push-button control of the system and basic home automation.
