<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. If a patient is having difficulty, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is typically open or generally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and notifies, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceptualized an approach of not only supplying the customer with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their antiquated nurse call station system.</p>
