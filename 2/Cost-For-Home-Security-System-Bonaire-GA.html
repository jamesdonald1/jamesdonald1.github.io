Whether you're utilizing a wireless IP-based system or sign up for a security part as a part of a "smart home" bundle; these technologies depend on user passwords to arm and deactivate them.

If you go on vacation and have someone coming over to feed pets or check on your home, set a temporary password and reset it as quickly as you return. As more recent security systems transition to cloud-based, wireless platforms, it is necessary to guard yourself against network intrusion just as you would with protecting your identity and virtual properties online.</p>
