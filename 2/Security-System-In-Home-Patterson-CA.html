<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings.
