<p>Video and image feeds have shown vital for surveillance - however there's room for more performance by utilizing audio. People have 5 senses that jointly allow us to accurately vary our environment. For that reason, it just makes good sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more effective.

<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection.

The system can be established to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end.
