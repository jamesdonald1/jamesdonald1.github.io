When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, should supply at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly fee ).
