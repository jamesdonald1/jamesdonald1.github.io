<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Wireless is the method of the future. Some leading home security companies offer professional installation, while others preconfigure your system at the factory and ship to your door for merely Do It Yourself setup. See the best wireless options listed below. Frontpoint Security uses a wise and easy monitored home security service, utilizing a large range of different wireless gadgets.

Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends upon your specific requirements and budget; are you putting them inside your home or outdoors? Is 1080P a large sufficient resolution? Will they be able to see and record video effectively in low-lighting? Are they placed with adequate field of vision, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be required? These are all important concerns to be thought about when selecting security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>

With a PTZ (Pan Tilt & Zoom) camera, your security group can have complete control on what is taped.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
