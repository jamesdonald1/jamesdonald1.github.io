After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the producer's stats since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life by far.

<p>Keypad: A smartphone app is a must for usage when you're away from home, but you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going.

When you add other Ring products to Ring Alarm it ends up being a more robust security system that can provide live video streaming, two-way communication, and wise lighting. Of course, at that point, the cheap cost ends up being more costly.</p>
