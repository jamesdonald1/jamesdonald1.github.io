If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers fund cops response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to robbery reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
