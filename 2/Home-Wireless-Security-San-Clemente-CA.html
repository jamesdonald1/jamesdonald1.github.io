<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by.
