<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stay with them longer, since switching monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
