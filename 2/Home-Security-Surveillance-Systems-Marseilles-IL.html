<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later created to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split.

The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
