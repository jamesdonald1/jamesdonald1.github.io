<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction.

Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
