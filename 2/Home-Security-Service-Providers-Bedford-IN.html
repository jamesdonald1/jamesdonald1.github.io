<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
