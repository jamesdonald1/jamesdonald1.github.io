<p>We still believe the Ring Alarm is a great alternative for a cheap home security system with smart home support. However perhaps avoid the cameras in the meantime. Disk drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems using expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand eliminate to transfer the data? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox?
