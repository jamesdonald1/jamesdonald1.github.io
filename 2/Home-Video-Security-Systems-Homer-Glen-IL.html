The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
