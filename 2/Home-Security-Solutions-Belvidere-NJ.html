<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly setting off when movement was spotted. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.

It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
