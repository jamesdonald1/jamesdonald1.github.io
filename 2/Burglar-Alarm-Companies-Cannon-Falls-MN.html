<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire family will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we regularly experiment with their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our newest round of screening, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason.

However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have essential fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
