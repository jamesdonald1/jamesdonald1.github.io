<h3>Home Alarm Security System in Georgia</h3>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
