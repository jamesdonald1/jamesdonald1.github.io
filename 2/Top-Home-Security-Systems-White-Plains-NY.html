<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
