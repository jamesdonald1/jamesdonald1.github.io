The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
