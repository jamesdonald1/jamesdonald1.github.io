<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems meant to summon police department workers, requires registration, assessment of costs for extreme false alarm system, supplies treatments for repeat culprits, and supplies an effective date. Whether you're utilizing a wireless IP-based system or register for a security element as a part of a "clever home" bundle; these innovations depend on user passwords to equip and deactivate them.
