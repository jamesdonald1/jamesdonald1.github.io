<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
