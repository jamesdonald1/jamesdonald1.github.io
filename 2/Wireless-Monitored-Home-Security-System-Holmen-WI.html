<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, however the black and white version can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage.

This implies that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, especially if your property is larger than 4,500 square feet.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
