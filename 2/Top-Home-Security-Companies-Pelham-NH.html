<p>If you wish to playback your home's outdoor activity, you'll require a camera with onboard video storage or cloud recording abilities. Most cameras with recording abilities have a built-in secure digital (SD) or microSD slot that allows for adequate recording area. When the sd card is full, you'll need to delete footage or store it somewhere else. Some popular cameras instantly bypass ended videos, which might not be most ideal if you need to keep a video.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features.
