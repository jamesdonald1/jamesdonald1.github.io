<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic smart home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for would-be bundle burglars or speak with visitors who stop by.</p>
