Throughout testing, we found it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly setting off when movement was identified. We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
