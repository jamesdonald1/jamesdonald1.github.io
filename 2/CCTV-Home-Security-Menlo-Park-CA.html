<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
