The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
