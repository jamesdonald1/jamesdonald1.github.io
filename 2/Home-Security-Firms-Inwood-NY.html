<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. With years of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle services and homes, we've built fantastic relationships with both local police forces and their customers. Also, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and vulnerable to exploits. It almost does not matter how strong your password is or if your software application is up to date if cybercriminals can simply pirate your Wi-Fi information. Aside from security, Outright Security Alarms has home automation items and solutions. 2GIG's control panel can speak and control simple home automation products like door locks, lighting, thermostats, and small appliance modules.</p>

Remote Video Surveillance lets you keep an eye on your business no matter where you are, while video retrieval helps you maintain and discover taped video.

<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses assigned to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more proficiency to setup, and typically cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units communicate with a control board. These are readily available in two kinds: they can be a physical panel that's set up within the home on a wall, or a virtual panel that's regulated and available via smartphone or tablet.</p>

<p>If you utilize Alexa to control the wise lights in your home, then you must consider experimenting with Alexa Guard, a relatively new home security mode with a couple of cool techniques. After turning Guard Mode on in the Alexa app's settings, simply state, "Alexa, I'm leaving" as you leave the door to trigger it. From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll also get an alert if your Echo speakers hear the sound of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
<p>Although entry and exit trigger times are adjustable (as much as 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the action time in our tests was constantly constant: In every one of our tests, the POLICES monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded. The service. was constantly polite, and for security it requires a safe word to bring back the peace.
