<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately switch off the heating systems. You can automatically make the clever lights turn on to frighten away prospective intruders if the motion sensing units are activated.</p>
