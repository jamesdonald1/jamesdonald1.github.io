<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
