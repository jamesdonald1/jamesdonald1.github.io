<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced wise home fanatics or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Some companies utilize a one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter approach to home security. However at Valley Alarm, we know that every situation is special.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
