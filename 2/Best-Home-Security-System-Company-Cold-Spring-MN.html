Try to find a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range approximately 25 feet, and cost effective cloud storage for recorded video. In some cases it's practical to be able to see what occurred just before or after a visitor approaches your door. For that, you'll require a doorbell that uses pre-buffering to record the action happening prior to motion is detected or the doorbell is pushed.</p>
