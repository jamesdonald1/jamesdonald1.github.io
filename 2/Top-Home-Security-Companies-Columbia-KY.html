<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.
