<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
