<p>This awesome smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was found. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly.
