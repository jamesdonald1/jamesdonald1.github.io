It isn't extremely wise. Wireless devices communicate more safely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>
<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (frequently very high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors sometimes) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.
