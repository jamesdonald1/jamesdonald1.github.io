The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the harmful assailant to tape these codes and use different splitting tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
