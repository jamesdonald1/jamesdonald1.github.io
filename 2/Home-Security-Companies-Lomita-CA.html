<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce criminal offense. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we may review this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
