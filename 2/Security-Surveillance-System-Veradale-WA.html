<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. Because it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Regrettably I purchased 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
