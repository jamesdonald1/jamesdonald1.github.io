Sometimes you do not even need to hardwire them, depending on which design you pick. Similar to any security system, the more equipment you add, the pricier it gets.

Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for outdoor and indoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on.
