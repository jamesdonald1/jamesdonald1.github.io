<p>Twenty-five years ago, basic and business interactions were primarily simultaneous. To achieve nearly anything, somebody live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when handling national and global business.

Generally, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a security personnel monitoring the corridors and another person, someplace, enjoying video surveillance screens for support. Everything is integrated and everything takes place in genuine time.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
