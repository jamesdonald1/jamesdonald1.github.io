<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced smart home enthusiasts or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, including clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>Unmonitored systems will not supply the same level of protection for your home, either.
