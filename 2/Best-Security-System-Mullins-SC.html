Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs howl, felines shriek, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>

It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant.</p>
<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also functions as a motion detector. It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion discovered, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can respond to it instantly. Furthermore, the motion sensing unit here is even more advanced than the ones offered by adobe Starter Set. Given that it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it only gets triggered when it captures motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., individuals and animals. Additionally, it doesn't get triggered by small things. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most sophisticated motion sensing units that remove all incorrect alarms and just gets triggered when individuals approach it.</p>
