<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
