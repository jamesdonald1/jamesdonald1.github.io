<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
