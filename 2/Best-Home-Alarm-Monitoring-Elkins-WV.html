It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage.
