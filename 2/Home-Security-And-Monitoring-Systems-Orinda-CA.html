<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
