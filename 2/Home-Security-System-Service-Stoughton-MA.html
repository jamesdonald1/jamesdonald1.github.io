<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm technology has actually established considerably since the 19th century, it is still based upon the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell.

Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and sometimes, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most durable. Because their style allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options.

<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
