<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
