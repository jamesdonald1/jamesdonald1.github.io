<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations.

As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop.
