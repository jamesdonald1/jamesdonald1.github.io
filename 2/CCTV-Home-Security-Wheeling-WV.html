<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

<p>On the surface, these 2 camera classifications may appear similar, though if you had the ability to see inside, the distinctions end up being obvious and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are developed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is plenty of available light, and once the lighting becomes absent or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video, commercial cameras outshine their less expensive cousins.</p>
