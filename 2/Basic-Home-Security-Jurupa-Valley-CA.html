<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire household will love. ADT is a household name, so we regularly try their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our newest round of screening, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor. We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint.
