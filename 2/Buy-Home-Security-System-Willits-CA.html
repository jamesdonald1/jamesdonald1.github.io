<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
