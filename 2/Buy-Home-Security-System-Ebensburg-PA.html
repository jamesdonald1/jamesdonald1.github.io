No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
