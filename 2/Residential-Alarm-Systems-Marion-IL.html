<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>
