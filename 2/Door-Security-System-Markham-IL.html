<h3>Home Monitoring System in Markham IL</h3>

The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of a problem is in between recording and finding motion. It takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it identifies motion because the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording. They might get past the camera prior to it had time to record them if a wicked criminal was fast enough. Smart phones can also now be used to from another location set and unset alarms through apps.</p>

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
<p>DURESS CODES - A little known function that is available on professionally monitored alarm systems is the ability to establish a pressure code that will disarm the alarm system but likewise calmly send out a panic alarm to the monitoring service if you need aid.
