A couple of designs use batteries, making placement more versatile, however this needs other compromises, which we highlight in the Competition section. Wi-Fi protection also affects where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater.
