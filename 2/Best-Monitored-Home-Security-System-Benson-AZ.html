<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
