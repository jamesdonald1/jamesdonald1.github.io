<h3>Outdoor Surveillance Camera South Gate CA 90280</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the maker's statistics considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit restricted to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>A good professional alarm monitoring company will have quick response times, which is necessary for your safety and security. Studies have shown that approximately 70 percent of burglaries that are not finished are because of the noise of an alarm. Once the cameras were attached, we monitored day and night activities, consisting of the comings and goings of two grownups, one child, and a pet dog. In our testing, we paid specific attention to tape-recording quality and length, frequency of signals, the app smart-home, geofencing, and user interface combination.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
