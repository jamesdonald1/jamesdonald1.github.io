<p>There have long been reputable rules governing the audio recording of people without their approval (there is a factor surveillance cameras never have microphones).

However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked only about half of the camera and the time regularly detached from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, along with when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
