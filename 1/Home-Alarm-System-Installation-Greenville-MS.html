The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
