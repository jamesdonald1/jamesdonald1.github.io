<p>Ring might not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has gained rather the excitement over the years. We've been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring charges.

<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera.

<p>ADT authorized provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states deserves $1,300. The equipment's all offered by third parties, so what you get might be from a various manufacturer than the equipment your neighbor received. Why's that?

<p>We also like that Ring still has decent smart home assistance. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home gadgets like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your wise outlets with your overall security system. With the advances in innovation, monitoring a home security system is relatively easy.
