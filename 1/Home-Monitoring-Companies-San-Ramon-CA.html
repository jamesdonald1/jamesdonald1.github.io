That means the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape once again, which suggests you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 per month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't advise that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
