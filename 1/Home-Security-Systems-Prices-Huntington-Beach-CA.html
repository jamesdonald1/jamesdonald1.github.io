<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send out informs, ensure it works with other smart gadgets. Lots of current outdoor Wi-Fi cameras use support for IFTTT (If This Then That), a web service that uses small programs (applets) that you create to have the camera communicate with other IFTTT-enabled gadgets. For instance, you can have a wise plug turn on a light inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
