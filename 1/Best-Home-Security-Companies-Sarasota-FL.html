<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
