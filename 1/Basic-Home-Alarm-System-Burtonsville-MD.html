<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
