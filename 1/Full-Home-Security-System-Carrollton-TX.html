<p>Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free.
