<h2>Video Surveillance Cameras In Schools Bloomsburg</h2>

<h3>Wireless Camera Security System in Bloomsburg PA</h3>
<p>However, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. Still quite expensive, however they can record video images at resolutions of 1, 2, 3, 5 and even up to 11 Mpix.

A lot of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's community measures up to that. It's all the function with no aggravation.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then broadcast over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
