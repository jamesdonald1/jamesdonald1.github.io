By looking up the license plate varieties of cars parked at the club and researching the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were wed.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
