<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
