<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much picture information as 1080p.

There are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
