I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for example. However, those features come at a relatively steep price: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for one month of video history.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
