If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities if you buy HD-CCTV security system.
