<h3>Safety Alarm System For Home in Westfield NJ</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control board (generally located in the entryway hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensors have been set off, clever alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have been activated, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly frustrating your neighbours). However, wise alarms do require a center that allows the different elements to wirelessly link. But for many wise alarms this center can be placed throughout your home.</p>

Instead, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or set off the siren.
