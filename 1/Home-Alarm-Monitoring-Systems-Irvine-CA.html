<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of straight plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cables. DVR systems are challenging to scale up because once every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire an entirely new DVR prior to including another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>Flood sensing units do not prevent water from entering your home, they just inform you as soon as moisture is found.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
