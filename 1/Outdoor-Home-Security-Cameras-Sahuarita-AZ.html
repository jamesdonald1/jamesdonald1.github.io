<p>Motion sensors use backup protection in case a burglar handles to get into your home. But they only operate when you're out of the house.

Since contract-based security systems usually do not featured upfront costs. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year agreements!
