Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
