The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
