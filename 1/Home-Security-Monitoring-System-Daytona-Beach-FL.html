It likewise features two days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of approximately 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
