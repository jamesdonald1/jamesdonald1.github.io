<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you stroll by.
