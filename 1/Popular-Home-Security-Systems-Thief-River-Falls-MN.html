<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
