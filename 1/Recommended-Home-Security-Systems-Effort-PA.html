It has about 25 feet of exposure during the night.

And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year. But if you want the outright best when it concerns video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
