<p>If you have an interest in the Google Nest Secure, you'll have the most success in the way of a neatly-integrated home security community by sticking to Nest items. Some of Google Nest's cameras do provide facial acknowledgment, but they can't trip alarms (based upon whether they acknowledge someone or otherwise).

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

It has about 25 feet of exposure during the night. As such, even if someone breaks into your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your mobile phone app. The only problem here is that the tape-recorded footage will be white and black and a little dark so you may not be able to see details clearly.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra does not come with a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you need to spend at least $3 each month if you wish to conserve any videos. And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year. But if you want the outright best when it concerns video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
