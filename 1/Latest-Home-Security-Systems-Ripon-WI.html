<p>Incorrect alarms are expensive for the City of Plymouth. Cops react to thousands of incorrect alarms each year. The function of an alarm ordinance is to motivate alarm users to preserve the functional reliability and proper usage of alarm and to reduce or remove false alarms.

In addition to monitoring your home's activity with door sensors and motion detection, lots of home security systems also support cameras, either inside or outside your home.

A great deal of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but couple of make things as easy as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's ecosystem measures up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>

When an alarm is triggered and view video from any of the installed security cameras, the screen lets you communicate with a professional monitoring service.</p>
