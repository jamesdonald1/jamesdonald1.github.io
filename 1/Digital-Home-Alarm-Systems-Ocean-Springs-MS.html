<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being watched by the authorities - or mindful they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people might find out to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang drug addicts, members or hookers." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
