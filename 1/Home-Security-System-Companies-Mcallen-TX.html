<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
