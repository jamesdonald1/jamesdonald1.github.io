As soon as we got a sufficient take a look at those friendly faces, we tilted the entire collection external for another two weeks to see what sort of results we would get when the cameras dealt with your home throughout the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.
