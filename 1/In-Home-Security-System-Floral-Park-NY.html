<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
