No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
