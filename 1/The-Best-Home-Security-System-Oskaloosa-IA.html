Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to keep and for how long you plan to keep taped video footage. The video is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
