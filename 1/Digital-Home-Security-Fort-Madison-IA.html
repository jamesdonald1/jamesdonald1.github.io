<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having trouble. This is a simple switch that is normally open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and signals, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceptualized a method of not only offering the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old nurse call station system.</p>
