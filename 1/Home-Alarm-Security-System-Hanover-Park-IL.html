<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand does not otherwise charge up front for a system it states is worth $1,300. The equipment's all supplied by 3rd parties, so what you receive might be from a various manufacturer than the equipment your next-door neighbor received. Why's that? ADT uses an independent supplier model including third-party dealers. The dealerships figure out which equipment to use. Expenses for systems vary. Bigger systems that offer full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most pricey options. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly option.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems usually don't come with upfront fees. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
