<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal activity avoidance created to avoid both individual and property criminal offense and can be used in location of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on created to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
