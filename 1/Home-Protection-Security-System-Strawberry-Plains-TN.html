It features HD live streaming, motion signals, person signals and access to the Nest Aware service option. Starting at $5 monthly, a Nest Aware subscription offers innovative functions like facial recognition.

<p>If your home is not pre-wired for a wired security system, the best option might be to go wireless. Wireless security systems are a network of sensors, motion detectors and surveillance cameras that can be installed without expert help and are entirely mobile. Because they depend on battery power, wireless systems will still work throughout a power blackout. Many wireless systems likewise work with your mobile phone, giving you the ability to monitor the system when you're not at home, as well as do things like change the thermostat or close the garage door from afar.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
