Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may learn to be careful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
