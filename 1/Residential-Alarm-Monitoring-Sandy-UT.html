Initially check the providers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice if you do buy them.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features.
