<p>While every property owner worries about burglaries, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a complimentary smart device app that allows residents who see something suspicious to take a picture and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For instance, a public transit rider may observe someone behaving suspiciously. Many people are messing, surfing or texting with their mobile phones.

Gadgets that feature the SimpliSafe system include the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensor and HD video quality, and a keychain remote utilized to arm or deactivate the system. Simplisafe does not include home automation features, aside from Nest combination, which might be a turn off for some.</p>
