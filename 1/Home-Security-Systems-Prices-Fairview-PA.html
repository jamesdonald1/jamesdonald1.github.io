The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further wiring.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the producer's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for brief battery life by far.
