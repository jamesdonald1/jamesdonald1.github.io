<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
