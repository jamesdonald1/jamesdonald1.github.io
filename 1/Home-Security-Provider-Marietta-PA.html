The procedure by which an alarm company receives signals from an alarm system and passes on an alarm dispatch demand to the municipality for the purpose of summoning police reaction to the alarm site.</p>
<p>The security systems I have actually created and implemented are strictly for monitoring activity of a possible target, whether from a terrorist hazard or community thieves or vandals. The systems are released for the protection of lives and residential or commercial property and not to watch people as they jaywalk throughout the street or run a red light (which both are, by the way, against the law). Those are various solutions with different requirements and objectives.</p>
<p>Basically the Mini Pano is designed around a gimmick: a huge fish-eye lens.

We implement the most recent in High Definition Camera Systems and Digital Camera Solutions.
