<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
