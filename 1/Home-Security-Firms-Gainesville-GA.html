We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs). Nevertheless, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
