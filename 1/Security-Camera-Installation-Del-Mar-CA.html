<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cable televisions. DVR systems are hard to scale up since once every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you require to acquire a totally new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
<p>While all plans include the Frontpoint app, to unlock video surveillance and advanced clever tech features, you'll need its $50-per-month Ultimate plan.
