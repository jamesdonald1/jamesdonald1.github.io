<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, however it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, suggesting you won't have the ability to link it directly to other third-party gadgets like smart locks or automate certain actions in the home. You can, however, use Alexa to arm or disarm the SimpliSafe system and link it to your Nest Thermostat to save energy based on when you're home or away.
