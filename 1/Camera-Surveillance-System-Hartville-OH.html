<p>Home security systems and modern clever home abilities and compatibilities enable you to tap into their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a model that provides a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for tape-recorded video.
