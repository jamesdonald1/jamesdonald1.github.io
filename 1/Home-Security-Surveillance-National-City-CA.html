If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which indicates. If somebody were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
