The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
