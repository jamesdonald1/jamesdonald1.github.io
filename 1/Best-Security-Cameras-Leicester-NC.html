<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. With years of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle organisations and homes, we have actually developed excellent relationships with both local police forces and their clients.

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your wise outlets with your total security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly easy.
