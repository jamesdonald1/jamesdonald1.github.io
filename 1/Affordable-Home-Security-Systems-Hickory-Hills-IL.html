Numerous insurance companies use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments provide a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
