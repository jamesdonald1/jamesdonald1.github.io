The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
