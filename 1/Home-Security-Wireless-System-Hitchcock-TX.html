<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, ought to offer at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to correctly identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording gaps throughout crucial security occasions. If home security is your main issue, we 'd advise one of our top choices, but the Arlo is terrific for signing in on family and family pets-- or stray felines slinking around your lawn.</p>
